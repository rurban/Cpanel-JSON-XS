And that is a) another iteration through the data b) require modification/or copy of original data c) slow (in pure perl it can take even more time that converting to JSON).\n\nSome similar questions on StackOverflow\n* https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29974529/perl-json-to-treat-all-numbers-as-string\n* https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17068764/why-does-the-json-module-quote-some-numbers-but-not-others\n* https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35227290/determining-if-a-perl-scalar-is-a-string-or-integer\netc.\n\nv1 of JSON had such a feature, check:\nhttp://search.cpan.org/~makamaka/JSON-1.15/lib/JSON.pm#AUTOCONVERT","files":null}]}
