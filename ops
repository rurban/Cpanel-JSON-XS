Objects are allowed.\n\n`$o=Cpanel::JSON::XS-\u003enew;print ref $o-\u003enew` returns an object of `Cpanel::JSON::XS`.\n`$o=Cpanel::JSON::XS::new(\"JSON::XS\");print ref $o-\u003enew` returns an object of `JSON::XS` but with the fields of Cpanel::JSON::XS. It does no harm, it just uses the class of the existing object.\n\nWhat pp_bless additionally does, but (Cpanel::)?JSON::XS not, are three checks: \n* \"Attempt to bless into a freed package\"\n* \"Attempt to bless into a reference\" *I think you want this*\n* \"Explicit blessing to '' (assuming package main)\"\n\nThat would be overkill to add those checks also. No other XS constructor does this, just PP constructors.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"a839ab4dd06318ecf49ebdac916158e1ab2703a4"},"timestamp":1501381225,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxODg3MzAxNA==","github-url":"https://github.com/rurban/Cpanel-JSON-XS/issues/93#issuecomment-318873014"},"message":"Feel free to close it then, if you want.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"42b8049125821cad60d350df07d9d216b854f3f7"},"timestamp":1501391359,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxODg3ODk4OQ==","github-url":"https://github.com/rurban/Cpanel-JSON-XS/issues/93#issuecomment-318878989"},"message":"Still thinking a bit over this...","files":null},{"type":5,"author":{"id":"42b8049125821cad60d350df07d9d216b854f3f7"},"timestamp":1501942986,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDExOTQyMDYxNjE="},"added":["not repro"],"removed":[]},{"type":5,"author":{"id":"42b8049125821cad60d350df07d9d216b854f3f7"},"timestamp":1501943093,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDExOTQyMDY2NDY="},"added":["enhancement"],"removed":[]},{"type":5,"author":{"id":"42b8049125821cad60d350df07d9d216b854f3f7"},"timestamp":1501943093,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDExOTQyMDY2NDc="},"added":["questionable"],"removed":[]},{"type":5,"author":{"id":"42b8049125821cad60d350df07d9d216b854f3f7"},"timestamp":1501943093,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDE0OlVubGFiZWxlZEV2ZW50MTE5NDIwNjY0OA=="},"added":[],"removed":["not repro"]}]}
