Perhaps stringify all objects such as Mojo::JSON does currently (better for debugging), or another possibility is to detect if the object has overload defined. Either way would make Cpanel::JSON::XS compatible with Mojo::JSON for structures which contain e.g. Mojo::ByteStream objects, or DateTime objects.","files":null}]}
