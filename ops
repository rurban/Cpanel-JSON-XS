Relaxed mode allows duplicate keys, but there is no way to allow duplicate keys without turning on relaxed mode. Unlike the other syntax allowed by relaxed mode, duplicate keys are still valid (the spec only says that keys SHOULD be unique). In addition, JSON::PP, JSON::XS, and Mojo::JSON all allow duplicate keys, so this option would help with cross compatibility.","files":null}]}
