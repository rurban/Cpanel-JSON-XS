Its kind of unexpected behavior for JSON::XS users. Also it doesn't pass Moose's 'Bool' constraint. It doesn't mean this is bad/wrong, but I see no explanations/background of this change in 3.0201\n\nBtw, #29 suggested \"1\" and \"0\" and it was so for a while, but then changed back again.","files":null}]}
