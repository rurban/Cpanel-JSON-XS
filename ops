My API client library did `use JSON` and all my tests were good. When I started using the library in an environment where `Cpanel::JSON::XS` was imported, my type constraints started to fail due to the override of `JSON::PP::Boolean`.\n\nI handled this for the moment with coercion for the Moose attributes, but it was a bit of a surprise to discover this difference.\n\nIf you don't have strong opinions on this front, I would propose consistency with other notions of string boolean in JSON libraries, Moose, and `boolean.pm`: use \"1\" and \"0\" as the string representations of `Cpanel::JSON::XS::true`/`Cpanel::JSON::XS::false`.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"28e6789c3b9342dcd34b9df0e27fde14256b6d32"},"timestamp":1492526212,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5NDg2NDk4Mg==","github-url":"https://github.com/rurban/Cpanel-JSON-XS/issues/61#issuecomment-294864982"},"message":"@kanatohodets, I strongly agree with you.
