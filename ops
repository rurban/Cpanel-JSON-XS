That's a HPUX libm glitch 5.20 cannot not handle yet. The inf/nan libm probes were only added with 5.22. I'll have to todo these inf/nan test. \nDo you have a 5.22 perl on HPUX also? Would be interesting to know if 5.22 fixed those results.\n\nOops, forgive me. I misread your description, I read 5.20 instead of 5.22. So this is really a Cpanel::JSON::XS issue. I'll look into it.","files":null},{"type":5,"author":{"id":"42b8049125821cad60d350df07d9d216b854f3f7"},"timestamp":1451587937,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDUwMzUxMDI2OA=="},"added":["bug"],"removed":[]},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"cfbcaa4ccc85c548a53773770f9acbb38aa86d86"},"timestamp":1475521064,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1MTE5MzkyMA==","github-url":"https://github.com/rurban/Cpanel-JSON-XS/issues/56#issuecomment-251193920"},"message":"This was also raised in the JSON-MaybeXS queue under https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=110807.","files":null},{"type":2,"author":{"id":"42b8049125821cad60d350df07d9d216b854f3f7"},"timestamp":1475560392,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDE3OlJlbmFtZWRUaXRsZUV2ZW50ODExMjc5MzQ3"},"title":"inf/nan detection on HP-UX","was":"inf/nan detection on HP-UX"},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"42b8049125821cad60d350df07d9d216b854f3f7"},"timestamp":1477485188,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1NjMzMzQ2OQ==","github-url":"https://github.com/rurban/Cpanel-JSON-XS/issues/56#issuecomment-256333469"},"message":"Fixed with 421911486efdc303b1d79a6277b795cbaec30a4 for 3.0217_01\nIf still an issue please re-open","files":null},{"type":4,"author":{"id":"42b8049125821cad60d350df07d9d216b854f3f7"},"timestamp":1477485188,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50ODM2OTcwNDY3"},"status":2}]}
