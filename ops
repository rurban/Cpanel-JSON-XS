It seems to accept the single quote as part of the string quotation instead of a regular character:\n`, or } expected while parsing object/hash, at character offset 21 (before \"s it hangin 1\"\\n}\\n\") at ../test.pl line 17.`\n\nThe bisection of this second issue goes back to the original allow_bare commit, so i missed some cases yesterday.. won't probably be able to look closer into it for a couple of days, sorry!","files":null}]}
