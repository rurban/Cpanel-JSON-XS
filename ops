Relaxed mode allows\n\u003e duplicate keys, but there is no way to allow duplicate keys without turning\n\u003e on relaxed mode.\n\u003e\nNo, to my knowledge we've added an allow_dupkeys option independent of\nrelaxed.\nif not that's a bug, but I believe there's a testcase to turn on only\ndupkeys.\n\n\nUnlike the other syntax allowed by relaxed mode, duplicate keys are still\n\u003e valid (the spec only says that keys SHOULD be unique). In addition,\n\u003e JSON::PP, JSON::XS, and Mojo::JSON all allow duplicate keys, so this option\n\u003e would help with cross compatibility.\n\u003e\n\u003e â€”\n\u003e You are receiving this because you are subscribed to this thread.\n\u003e Reply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\n\u003e \u003chttps://github.com/rurban/Cpanel-JSON-XS/issues/122\u003e, or mute the thread\n\u003e \u003chttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AACjUY53Qiowe_FYp5BSYHYntx5sApo0ks5vNbgXgaJpZM4a8Rm-\u003e\n\u003e .\n\u003e","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"d19730b1d47a47ba43733401ca1bc3d2bbb7f976"},"timestamp":1550218944,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2Mzk0OTMyNA==","github-url":"https://github.com/rurban/Cpanel-JSON-XS/issues/122#issuecomment-463949324"},"message":"There's no option that I can find:\n\n```\n\u003e perl -MCpanel::JSON::XS -E'say Cpanel::JSON::XS-\u003eVERSION; Cpanel::JSON::XS-\u003enew-\u003eallow_dupkeys'\n4.08\nCan't locate object method \"allow_dupkeys\" via package \"Cpanel::JSON::XS\" at -e line 1.\n```","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"42b8049125821cad60d350df07d9d216b854f3f7"},"timestamp":1550219222,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2Mzk1MDUyMg==","github-url":"https://github.com/rurban/Cpanel-JSON-XS/issues/122#issuecomment-463950522"},"message":"Oops, I see.
