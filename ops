Is there any way I can do it with Cpanel::JSON::XS?\n\nSo my desired result is to get this kind of strucre from `{\"a\":true, \"b\":true}`:\n\n```\n$VAR1 = {\n          'a' =\u003e 1,\n          'b' =\u003e 1,\n        };\n```\n\nI need to do such convertion because I'm sending some parts of this perl data structure to some other code that does not work well with blessed objects.\n\nI'm expecting this task to have a simple solution, but I can't find out how to do it. Can you please help?","files":null}]}
